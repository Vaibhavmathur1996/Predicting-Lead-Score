# Predicting-Lead-Score
In this there is a python notebook . The task is to predict the score or quality of leads generated by marketing team in the company . This helps the sales department to sort the leads and can analyse on which leads they had to hit first . In this Algorithms  I had used ---> RandomForestRegressor (Accuracy = 0.678)  , Gradient Boosting Regressor (Accuracy = 0.699)
